This web app collects mercury data from various industries in Nigeria in order to help Environmental Managers know mercury usage, emmission, waste and mercury-compound waste based on the United Nations Environmental Project's Minimata Convention on Mercury
The application also plots a graph showing how much mercury waste is generated by the industries over time.
