# Mercury Management Information System
This is application collects mercury data from various industries in Nigeria in order to help Environmental Managers know what industries are generating the largest mercury waste.
The application also plots a graph showing how much mercury waste is generated by the industries over time.
This is based on the United Nations Environmental Project's Minimata Convention on Mercury.
